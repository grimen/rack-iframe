== HIGH-PRIO

x [feature/issue]: Fix/Review "Last-Modified" HTTP cache header case - to comply with W3C spec.


== LOW-PRIO

- [feature]: Track if P3P-headers should be sent via cookie. Reason: We can't assume that only bodies that contain <iframe>-elements needs the P3P header (or so I think right now).

- [feature]: Add option to send 304 headers but delete "Set-Cookie"-header - not allowed by spec, but seems to work in most browsers/servers anyway.

- [refactor/enhancement]: Use 'useragent' gem to parse 'USER_AGENT'-header - https://rubygems.org/gems/useragent

- [refactor/test]: Use proper integration testing, i.e. mocks/env => Sinatra/headers.

== MAYBE

- [feature]: Optionally silently/evily inject "the cross-domain iframe JavaScript hack" for Safari - or specified user agents - into the body response. >:)
- [feature]: Support for policy reference file. http://www.w3.org/TR/P3P/#ref_file
- [feature]: Support for specifying compact policies by configuration. http://www.w3.org/TR/P3P/#compact_policies http://www.p3pwriter.com/LRN_111.asp
